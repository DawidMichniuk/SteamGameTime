# SteamGameTime
Allow anyone to see the amount of time they've spend on steam games.

To make this usable you need to have a steam developer/api key and a steam ID of user you want to check out.

You can get a steam API key from: https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
Since our application is used locally you can enter 127.0.0.1 as domain.

You can get steamID from https://store.steampowered.com/ and clicking on your nickname
which would then transfer you to something like:
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/home/


Requires requests module for python:
pip install requests
