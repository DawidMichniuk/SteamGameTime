# It connects to steam api to get all owned games by the user with the specified
# steamID, along with their titles. Since we use steam's API, we needs a steam
# developer API key to connect to said services. I can't share mine in fear of
# some misusage, since I would be the one to blame.

# To include app info(logo, icon and name) and the last one is for including
# free to play games.
